# Iconography

---

Fractal uses the [Unicons icon library](https://iconscout.com/unicons) in the
[Line version (free)](https://iconscout.com/unicons/explore/line).

## Usage

It's recommended to add the `@iconscout/react-unicons` package as a dependency
so you can import any Line icon in your React components and use it as any other
React component.

A good practice is to import each single icon instead of using the barrel file
to allow tree-shaking and reduce the size of your bundle:

```jsx
import UilIcons from '@iconscout/react-unicons/dist/icons/uil-icons'
```

## Available icons

> Click on an icon to copy its name to your clipboard.

<div className="icons">
  {Object.entries(icons).map(([iconName, icon], index) => (
    // eslint-disable-next-line jsx-a11y/click-events-have-key-events, jsx-a11y/no-static-element-interactions
    <div
      key={index}
      className="icon"
      title={iconName}
      onClick={() => {
        navigator.clipboard.writeText(iconName)
      }}
    >
      <div className="icon-name">{iconName}</div>
      {createElement(icon, { size: 56 })}
    </div>
  ))}
</div>
