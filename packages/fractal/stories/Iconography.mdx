# Iconography

---

Fractal uses the [Unicons icon library](https://iconscout.com/unicons) in the
[Line version (free)](https://iconscout.com/unicons/explore/line).

## Usage

It's recommended to add the `@iconscout/react-unicons` package as a dependency
so you can import any Line icon in your React components and use it as any other
React component.

> The official `react-unicons` library hasn't been updated in a while.

> ```bash
> yarn add @iconscout/react-unicons@Azuky/react-unicons

A good practice is to import each single icon instead of using the barrel file
to allow tree-shaking and reduce the size of your bundle:

```jsx
import UilIcons from '@iconscout/react-unicons/icons/uil-icons'
```

<div className="icons">
  {Object.entries(icons).map(([iconName, icon], index) => (
    <div
      key={index}
      className="icon"
      role="button"
      tabIndex={-1}
      title={iconName}
      onClick={() => {
        navigator.clipboard.writeText(
          `import ${iconName} from '@iconscout/react-unicons/icons/${kebabCase(
            iconName,
          )}'`,
        )
      }}
      onKeyDown={(event) => {
        if (event.key === 'Enter') {
          navigator.clipboard.writeText(
            `import ${iconName} from '@iconscout/react-unicons/icons/${kebabCase(
              iconName,
            )}'`,
          )
        }
      }}
    >
      <div className="icon-name">{iconName}</div>
      {createElement(icon, { size: 56 })}
    </div>
  ))}
</div>
